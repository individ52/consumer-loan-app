TASK:

Create a simple consumer loan app.

The app is a headless web service that exposes the following endpoints:
● Apply for a loan by providing loan amount, term, name, and personal id
● List all loans by a borrower (you can skip the authorization part)

Lending rules:
● Monthly interest rate: 5%

Reject the loan application if:
● The borrower is blacklisted (store blacklisted personal ids in a config file or a database)
● There have been too many applications from one personal id in the last 24 hours

Project description:
This project is a simple bank API, that makes it possible to apply loans, get borrower loans and get payment shedule for Differentiated and equal loan.
In project is also implemented the functionality of blocking: if the user tries to apply loan more than once in 24 hours and tries to do it more than 3 times, user will be banned.
There is also oppartunity to ublock user.

Project code quality:

-   Project has authorization with jwt.
-   Node.js + express.
-   Business functionality is separated from controllers.
-   There are 4 middlewares:

1. error-middleware - handle errors controll is user blocked or not and access to loan.
2. auth-middleware - controll token - is it valid + decode token to use in reqest user data.
3. blocked-middleware - there were created this middleware to make it easier block other endpoints for blocked users.
